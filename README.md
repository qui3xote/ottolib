# ottolib

## What is ottolib?
`ottolib` is a toolkit for parsing OttoScript files (*.otto) into python objects which can then be used to run home automations. For a full explanation of OttoScript (as well as end-user instructions for using it on HomeAssistant), see the main Otto repository.

## Installing ottolib
Installation is simply a matter of checking out the code from github. For those using this in combination with HomeAssistant OS, by default the Otto package looks in `/config/ottolib` so downloading this folder into `/config/` is sufficient. See the main Otto repository for complete instructions.

### requirements
Python 3.7+
Pyparsing 3.0+
